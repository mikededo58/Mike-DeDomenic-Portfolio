# Mike-DeDomenic-Portfolio

## Description

Created my own website to show my current and future projects that I have completed. The goal was to allow future employers to see how what work I have done in an easy to read website. I learned a lot about some of the more advanced aspects of CSS and HTML.

## Installation

The project was pushed to gitthub. from there I went to the pages and launched the manin branch of my repo. This created a live environment
